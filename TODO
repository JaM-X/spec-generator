General items:
- JaM-X package:
 - depend on rpm-build
 - create jamx user, sudoer for docker command
 - create these dirs under ~jamx/rpmbuild:
   BUILD BUILDROOT RPMS SRPMS
 - JaM-X scripts go to ~jamx/bin
 - configuration goes to ~jamx/etc


 RPM package:
 - depend on rpm-build vim-enhanced
 deb package:
 - depend on build-essential debhelper dh-make vim-nox

- create JaM org on docker hub
- create docker build containers for:
	- debian 8, testing and sid
	- ubuntu 14.04, 15.10
	- centos 6, 7

- Build generic templating mechanism based on dpkg's template mechanism only it would also allow setting a callback function for verifying inputs.
  - will support TUI and CLI

Things to think of:
 - if the package provides a daemon, need an init script/systemd template to start from



- if we're generating a new package:
	- get env matrix - i.e, on what distros this package should be built
	- get source URL
	- get version
	- write info to RC file
	- start a docker container of relevant distro
	- analyze source for build and runtime dependencies
	- preinstall needed build deps
	- generate spec 
	      - description
	      - source URL
	      - license - try to auto detect looking for files named license/i or copyright/i
	      - arch - try to auto detect whether noarch/indep according to source type. For example, if the source is PHP||Perl||Python||many others only, then it is indep.
	      - prompt for prefix dir
	      - changelog
		- for deb we have debchange and dh-make already takes care of the initial import, check what it does as far as setting the distro goes, we'll need to query the user for that and place in the build.rc file.
		- need a parallel for RPM
	      - auto detect config files
	      - auto detect init scripts
	      - source prep:
	              - remove {.git,.csv,.svn} files
		      - set proper permissions on files, i.e: remove redundant/add exec bit where needed
	      - dev package
	      - maintainer 
		- check MAIL and DEBEMAIL ENV vars for email
		- check DEBFULLNAME and MAINTAINER_NAME for name
	      - deb only: repo name to place in changelog file

- if we're just building a new version
