- get source URL or local FS path
	- if URL:
		- fetch and extract
	- if local
		- if archive
			- extract
	
- analyze source for build and runtime dependencies
- preinstall needed build deps
- generate spec 
      - description
      - source URL
      - license - try to auto detect looking for files named license/i or copyright/i
      - arch - try to auto detect whether noarch/indep according to source type. For example, if the source is PHP||Perl||Python||many others only, then it is indep.
      - changelog
	- for deb we have debchange and dh-make already takes care of the initial import
	- need a parallel for RPM
      - auto detect config files
      - dev package
      - maintainer 
	- check MAIL and DEBEMAIL ENV vars for email
	- check DEBFULLNAME and MAINTAINER_NAME for name

For deb packages dh_make makes a sound base for generating skeleton files, we then need to add the missing pieces.
For RPMs a new tool will need to be created
